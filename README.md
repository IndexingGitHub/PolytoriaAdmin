# PolyAdmin
Providing Polytoria games with moderation, fun, utility & misc commands. Made by Index.

> An example game with admin commands built in (free admin for all players visiting) can be visited here to try out the model before adding it into your own games: https://polytoria.com/games/2537

> You do not have to add your own USER ID to the "permissions" table if you are the owner of the game.

# Rewrite
**As of December 2022,** PolyAdmin is being rewritten to improve speed and backend code. It will also add tons of new features that weren't present in past versions.

# Prefix
To use commands, your message must start with a ":" colon (this can be changed later in settings per the game developer's wishes by changing the "prefix" variable at the top of the script).

# Command List
The full command list can be found in-game by running the **:cmds [utility / mod / fun]** command which requires a rank of admin or higher.
